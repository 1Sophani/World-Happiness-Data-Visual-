A data visualization class project in which 5 given datasets were given for the years 2015-2019.
Data wrangling techniques such as merging datasets, removing rows with null values, and PCA techniques were applied to clean the data without losing data integrity. 
The heat map was applied to better show the correlation between features.
Outliers were later removed to see the resulting difference from the data that included outliers.
